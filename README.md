## My projects

[Nocturne](https://github.com/MagnetMan103/Nocturne) 🎵   
This was a submission for the 2024 Big Red Hacks Hackathon. It
is a mobile app that creates an instrumental song based on the
user's mood. I used React Native + Expo to make the front-end, and 
I connected it to a Flask backend (that my awesome teammates made). 
We got **2nd place** in the general best solutions to the Hackathon's theme
of lifestyle.

[Vividly](https://github.com/MagnetMan103/Vividly) 👀  
This was a submission for the 2024 RCareWorld Hackathon. It's an app 
to help people with alzheimers remember important events in their life. It was
also a React Native + Expo front-end, with a Flask backend.
We won **1st place** for the software solutions track of creating solutions for existing systems.

[2500words](https://github.com/MagnetMan103/2500words) 📗  
This is a downloadable [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/oofdlpnfhhbepaebanohecbocjmbkfmd?hl=en&authuser=0) 
that helps you expand your vocabulary in a foreign language. It
saves your unknown words from a website and allows you to train them until you master them.
It supports 12 of the most popular languages currently. This is a personal project that I made
because I wanted to get better at French. 

[DebateFlow](https://github.com/MagnetMan103/debateflow) 📝  
This a deployed [website](https://debateflow.vercel.app/) used for making debate 'flows' (the structure for
taking notes in a debate round). I made this because I wanted a more convenient solution for creating and tracking 
my flows from judging debate rounds. It was made using the T3 stack (basically React + NextJS). Flows are also
stored locally on the user's browser to be revisited later.
